    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
        Taking their name from the Japanese concept of "true feelings" and one's intimate self, British duo HONNE combine soul with synths to convey their vision of musical intimacy. The pair of producers -- James Hatcher and Andy Clutterbuck -- met at university and began collaborating mere days after school started. Influenced by Al Green and Bill Withers, their warm electronic sound revealed hints of Quincy Jones' early work with Michael Jackson, spread over sensual nocturnal sonics.

        They released their debut EP, Warm on a Cold Night, in September 2014, followed that same year by All in the Value. After starting their own label, Tatemae Recordings, in 2015, they released two more EPs, Coastal Love and Over Lover. HONNE built an online following and toured in Europe, selling out shows in their home country. In January 2016, Gone Are the Days was released, featuring "No Place Like Home" with British soul singer JONES on vocals. A collaborative single with Izzy Bizu, "Someone That Loves You," followed months later as the pair prepared for a summer festival tour and their debut full-length album, which shared its name, Warm on a Cold Night, with their debut EP. They delivered the single "Just Dance" in 2017, followed by "I Got You" (featuring Nana Rogues) in 2018. Their sophomore set, Love Me/Love Me Not, arrived that summer.
